    p.longP In nowadays, with the environmental awareness rising, dioxin contamination in Taiwan is a big problem waiting to be solved in an efficient way. TonB and 2-haloacid dehalogenaseos come from <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> 869T2, which was isolated from the <i>Chrysopogon zizanioides</i>(=<i>Vetiveria zizanioides</i> ) at diesel polluted site called the China Petrochemical Development Corporation.  <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> 869T2 is a member of the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex (Bcc), which consists of several species of closely related and extremely versatile gram-negative bacteria found naturally in soil, water, and the rhizosphere of plants and may also cause plant or human disease (ex: cycstic fibrosis). However, through the WGS Chia-Jung Tsai discovered that there is a significant disparity between <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> 869T2 and other strains of <i>Burkholderia</i> <sup>[1]</sup>. And also through the 16S rRNA sequences, <i>Burkholderia seminalis</i> is the one which related to 869T2 the most in <i>Burkholderia spp.</i> which mainly purpose is to urge plant growth or to inhibit plant disease <sup>[2]</sup>. Despite the 869T2, we also ensure that all parts we’re using come from <i>Escherichia coli</i> (K12 strain), <i>Burkholderia phytofirmans</i> PsJN, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> rm125 and <i>Termitomyces</i> T984 are all in risk one. And for more information about 869T2 and PsJN you can see in the <a href=“http://2018.igem.org/Team:NCHU_Taichung/Background”>background</a>.

      | Since our project is mainly about the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, using dioxin in our experiment is inevitable. According to the research, Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is stable under ordinary conditions of storage and is considered relatively stable toward heat, acids, and alkalies
      sup [4][5]
      |. As the solubility in water is very little, we solute it in the methylbenzene. And the vapor pressure of 2,3,7,8-TCDD is very low so it’s difficult to volatilize. However, the expose of dioxin still might be the biggest safety problem, so we visit the dioxin-related expert in <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:NCHU_Taichung/Human_Practices#TACTRI">the Agricultural Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute(TACTRI).</a> Eventually, we sort out a safety manual from the lab training and also from the expert advice.
